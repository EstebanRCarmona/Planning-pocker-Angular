# Planning Poker

The **Planning Poker** application is built in Angular and is designed to facilitate agile estimation sessions using the planning poker technique. In this app, users are visualized around a virtual table, represented by cards, and they can select cards displaying Fibonacci values. Once the cards are revealed, the average value is calculated and shown to help guide the estimation process. The application is designed with Atomic Design principles and uses semantic HTML for improved structure and accessibility.
